Seiya narrowly managed to rescue Saori
after she was kidnapped
by Jamian and his army of crows.
However, the two of them were cornered
after Shaina suddenly appeared.
With no choice left, he held Saori tight
and plunged into the ravine below.
Shaina and Jamian hunted them down
and tried to finish off
the gravely injured Seiya...
but Athena's immense Cosmo
began to flow from Saori.
Although Hyoga and Shun
soon arrived to help,
a new pair of villainous
Silver Saints blocked their path.
Specter! The Line Between Life and Death
We're here to take Saori Kido
with us to Sanctuary.
What?
Who are you two?
I'm the Silver Saint, Cerberus Dante.
They call me the charioteer,
Auriga Capella.
You're all speeding right down
the highway to Hell.
Miss, please keep an eye on Seiya.
Of course.
We were tasked by the Pope
to bring the lady back with us.
If you hand her over nice and easy,
we'll let you live.
Right back at you. Unless you like
being dead, then get out of Japan!
Shut up! We won't take that attitude
from a puny Bronze Saint like you.
Let me...
...teach you some manners!
I'll be your opponent.
Or you can just go back to Sanctuary
and avoid a pointless fight.
As if!
We're going to slaughter the lot of you!
Capella, don't bother going easy on them!
Right!
These insolent Bronze Saints will regret
messing with us.
Take this!
Saucer Attack!
Nice dodge.
But that was just a warm-up throw.
The next one will take your head
right off your shoulders!
Just watch!
Hyoga, be careful!
Don't get in my way, chain boy!
Dante! Deal with this annoying brat!
Right!
Just wait,
I'll show you the power of my weapon
that once tamed the great hound of Hades!
Nebula Chain!
Shun!
Shun!
Diamond Dust!
Heh, you fell for it!
Hyoga, behind you!
Now you're mine!
Go and rot in Hell!
Hyoga! Shun!
Pathetic Bronze Saints,
they could never stand up to us.
Now then, Miss.
Come with us to Sanctuary,
nice and quietly.
Those angry eyes
really ruin your cute face.
Just give it up.
Whose Cosmo is this?
I'm feeling a Cosmo of immense power.
But from who?!
Up here!
Ikki!
This man's Cosmo...
it's perfectly honed for combat.
I'm not letting you lay a finger
on the lady.
Who the hell are you?
Nobody worth naming.
I'll just say that I'm a man
who's seen hell more than once.
You came back to us!
Don't expect me to stay long.
Huh?
I usually stick by my decisions
to the end.
What are you babbling about?
Stay out of our way,
or else you're dead meat!
I'd like to see you try.
Don't step one foot
across this line until we're gone.
If you do, then you die.
What?!
Come on, Miss.
We need to head back.
Head back?
Seiya's in trouble if we don't hurry.
Hang in there, Seiya.
Th-that bastard.
Cross the line and die?
We're not here to play kiddie games!
You're full of shit, Bronze Saint punk!
Capella!
I warned you! Cross that line and you die.
Dammit...
Hey, Shun! Wake up!
Hyoga! What happened to us?
We got really lucky.
If we didn't get caught on that tree,
we'd be dead.
This must be divine intervention.
Hyoga, what about Seiya and Saori?
Okay, Shun. You go up first.
Shun, you nearly gave me a heart attack!
Sorry about that.
We're even worse off than before.
I thought you were just a lowly Bronze
Saint, but who are you really?
All right, you can take my name
with you to Hell.
I am Phoenix Ikki!
"Phoenix"?
The one from Death Queen Island?
Oh?
So, you've heard of me.
I've heard rumors.
You must be the Phoenix Saint who crushed
all the Black Saints single handedly.
Then I'll hold nothing back!
You'll suffer under the shackles
of the mighty Cerberus Dante!
Here, catch!
You caught it with only one hand,
that's impressive.
Any normal Saint would have
had their hand ripped to shreds!
Then how about this instead?!
Hey, Phoenix.
Just so you know, your little
"cross the line" rule works both ways!
If you cross over to this side
then you're a dead man!
Oh?
That is the line between life and death
for both of us!
So, come on over here Phoenix!
You seem hesitant,
let me give you some motivation!
Ikki!
I-impossible...
I crossed the line.
What are you going to do now?
Smug bastard...
You have no idea.
I've spent my entire life crossing
the line between life and death.
Thanks to the wings of the Phoenix!
Phoenix Wing Ascent!
Hmph. If that's the best Silver Saints can
do, then they're absolutely pathetic.
Let's get moving.
Our battle isn't over just yet.
Dumbass, I eat pieces of shit like you
for breakfast.
This fight was so easy
I never even broke a sweat!
Sucks to be you, Phoenix!
It doesn't matter how strong you are,
you're still a Bronze Saint!
You can never compete with... huh?!
N-no way!
What is happening?!
You zombie freak! Take this!
Saucer Attack!
Wh-what the hell?
Why did my Saucer Attack turn on me?!
Is this all just a dream...?
It's far worse than any dream or illusion.
The first punch I hit you
with was no ordinary punch!
Capella, I completely destroyed
your mind with that attack.
It's my special technique,
the Phoenix Specter Punch!
You're nothing more
than a living corpse right now.
I-impossible...
Are you telling me I've
been hallucinating ever since then?
It doesn't matter, you're out of time.
Capella, the first saucer you threw
is on its way back now.
Ikki, what exactly happened just now?
It's only been a few seconds
since he attacked me with that saucer.
But he's been suffering a horrific
hallucination for much longer than that.
That takes care of them.
Ikki!
Hyoga and Shun fell down
the ravine earlier!
Miss, I'll be frank. If they can't make it
back up on their own,
then they don't deserve to be Saints.
I won't let him disgrace the proud name
of the Silver Saints...
I can't let it end like this!
I'm going to take them
all to Hell with me!
Look out!
Persistent bastard,
you should have let yourself die.
What are you hoping to do here?!
I'm going to send you
to the grave for good!
Don't even bother trying!
You're in no shape to beat me!
The spikes on my weapon
are about to prove you dead wrong!
Shun!
Brother.
Shun, I'll let you handle this.
Hyoga, you're in charge of Seiya.
Later guys.
Ikki! Please, I want you to stay with us!
Where are you going, Brother?
I go wherever I want.
I told you I hate playing sheepdog.
Shun, you should be able to take him down
even if he beat you once.
He's already got one foot in his coffin
after dealing with me.
Wh-what did you just say?!
Brother...
You're running away?!
Phoenix, I'm not done with you yet!
You'll have to settle for fighting me,
his little brother!
I shouldn't have to bother
with a pipsqueak like you!
Get out of my way!
I'll beat you no matter what you do!
I'll never know unless I try.
That's true of any Saint.
Because Saints never fall
for the same attack twice!
B-bullshit!
I'll kill you where you stand!
Take this!
Damn you meddling Bronze Saints!
I told you, Saints never fall
for the same attack twice.
There's no way for you to win,
you've lost too much power.
You're going to Hell, I'll stake
my pride as a Silver Saint on it!
U-unbelievable!
It should come as no surprise.
No matter how tough your weapon is,
any superior Cosmo power will crush it.
Your Cosmo is too weak
to put up a real fight.
Not to mention, I have my Nebula Chain!
Nebula Chain!
First Shiryu and now Seiya...
I'm sorry you've lost
so much because of me.
